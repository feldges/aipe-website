## The Business Tool Revolution

What do my daughter and my colleague trader have in common? They both are learning Python!

Python is becoming mainstream in business. Every day, more professionals discover its power. And with today’s AI assistants, learning Python is easier than ever before.

I’ve witnessed this transformation firsthand at a large financial institution. Business users are adopting Python at surprising rates. They make remarkable progress with AI coding assistants. What seemed impossible just two years ago is now becoming common practice.

## Excel vs. Python: A Changing Landscape

For decades, Excel has been the default tool for business users. It’s familiar and accessible. But Excel is fundamentally limited by its spreadsheet design. It struggles with data over a million rows. Complex formulas become unwieldy nests of functions. Version control is nearly impossible. Data validation remains challenging.

Python breaks free from these constraints. It processes datasets of any size. It handles complex algorithms elegantly. It integrates with any data source. It automates repetitive tasks effortlessly. This is why forward-thinking business users are increasingly choosing Python over Excel.

But there’s a significant challenge in this transition.

## The Sharing Problem

When business users create Python applications, they rarely share them with colleagues. This is unfortunate. Who understands specific business processes better than the users themselves? Their tools could benefit entire teams.

The reason for this sharing gap is straightforward. Building small Python applications has become easier. Making them accessible to others remains difficult.

Some companies use Jupyter notebooks as a sharing solution. This works well for technically-inclined people. It falls short for typical business users who are comfortable with Excel but not with coding environments.

Why is sharing Python applications so difficult?

First, Python code typically lives on the creator’s computer. Colleagues can’t easily access it. The solution requires deploying code on a shared server. Cloud computing helps, but technical hurdles remain.

Second, colleagues need a user-friendly interface. They expect to click buttons and fill forms, not to read code. Traditional solutions require learning additional programming languages beyond Python. This creates another barrier for business users.

## FastHTML: The Python-Based Solution

A new framework called FastHTML addresses these challenges directly. What makes FastHTML special is its Python foundation. Business users can stick with the language they’re already learning. No need to learn JavaScript or other web technologies.

FastHTML is designed to create modern interactive web applications with minimal code, accessible through any browser. Once deployed, anyone can use the application just like they would access a website. Sharing becomes simple and intuitive.

FastHTML offers several key advantages for business environments:

* **Pure Python Development**: Create complete applications using only Python — the same language business users are already adopting

* **Web-Based Sharing**: Applications automatically become web apps that colleagues can access through familiar browsers

## Real-World Impact

In a recent project, I have developed an investment reports generator ([link](http://storm.aipe.tech)). This tool simply takes a company name as input, conducts web research with reasoning capabilities, and generates a comprehensive investment report. The entire user interface — including access rights management — is built using FastHTML, and is simply integrated in the entire Python code.

This practical application demonstrates how business users can create sophisticated tools that are easily shared across an organization while maintaining appropriate security controls — something that would be challenging to accomplish with Excel alone.

## The Future: Python as the New Excel

With these technologies, my prediction is that Python will replace Excel as the primary business productivity tool. The advantage is clear: Python offers more power and flexibility than Excel, and frameworks like FastHTML solve the sharing challenge.

When business users who understand specific needs can develop Python solutions and easily share them with colleagues, it creates remarkable efficiency gains. IT bottlenecks disappear. Innovation accelerates.

## Taking the Next Step

Is your team starting to use Python? Are they creating valuable tools that others could benefit from? Consider exploring frameworks like FastHTML.

At AIPE Technology, we’ve built deep expertise with FastHTML and Python applications. We understand this technology well and are happy to share our insights with teams looking to move beyond Excel.

The shift from Excel to Python represents a significant opportunity. Let’s discuss how your team can develop and share business applications that go beyond Excel’s capabilities. Ready to start your Python transformation? Contact me at [info@aipetech.com](mailto:info@aipetech.com) today.
