In 2023, I had the unique opportunity to lead the deployment of Generative AI products for internal use at a large Swiss Asset Manager. This experience provided me with valuable insights into what works and what doesn’t when implementing this new technology in a corporate setting. In this post, I will share my learnings and offer guidance to those embarking on a similar journey.

**Secure Experimentation: The Foundation of Success**

The first critical step in any Generative AI deployment is to establish a secure, internal general-purpose “ChatGPT-like” chatbot that enables employees to experiment and leverage the technology for productivity gains. This not only demonstrates the company’s commitment to innovation but also ensures that sensitive data remains protected. With 75% of knowledge workers already using chatbots for their work ([according to Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part)), providing a secure platform is essential.

Equally important is securing the explicit support and encouragement of top management. Their commitment sends a powerful signal throughout the organization, fostering a culture of innovation and experimentation.

**Harnessing the Power of Bottom-up and Top-down Ideation**

Employees should be encouraged to use the technology in their daily work, share their experiences, and propose use cases. This bottom-up approach not only drives immediate productivity gains but also uncovers valuable insights for mid-term improvements.

Simultaneously, you can engage external consultants to identify top-down use cases that leverage industry best practices and emerging trends.

This combination of internal expertise and external perspective is a powerful catalyst for innovation.

**Upskilling: The Key to Unlocking Generative AI’s Potential**

Regular knowledge-sharing sessions with Generative AI champions are essential for driving adoption and fostering a culture of continuous learning. These meetings provide a platform for showcasing internal developments and exchanging valuable insights.

Technical employees, particularly software engineers, should be on-boarded early for upskilling. As Generative AI evolves beyond chatbots, companies that embrace these technologies will unlock phenomenal opportunities. Upskilling existing talent is more efficient than hiring scarce specialists, which are hard to find. And it is critical to have well skilled employees, to integrate Generative AI APIs into software applications. The barrier to using Generative AI has been significantly lowered with the rise of LLMs, which can simply be used as APIs. There is no need for deep knowledge of Machine Learning.

**Navigating the Generative AI Journey: Do’s and Don’ts**

To successfully deploy Generative AI, keep these key points in mind:

 1. Identify and empower your “hidden champions” — those individuals who are already well-versed in Generative AI and prompt engineering, which they are using sometimes extensively privately. Their expertise will be invaluable in driving projects forward.

 2. Approach consultants. But remember, they are on the same learning journey as you, experimenting with these emerging technologies. Engage them selectively!

**The Future of Generative AI: Beyond Chatbots**

While chatbots are an excellent starting point, they are merely the tip of the iceberg. My conviction is that Generative AI will become deeply integrated into software applications. For example, why not use Generative AI to reconcile trades from two different unstructured sources (and therefore difficult to semi-automate with traditional technologies)? Or why not use a translator for invoices? In an international company, invoices can be in any language, but are typically processed in one single region, with one language. These two examples are relatively easy to implement with the current technology. The possibilities are endless!

**Conclusion**

Deploying Generative AI in a corporate setting is an exciting and transformative journey. By following the strategic roadmap outlined in this post — from secure experimentation to upskilling and beyond — companies can successfully navigate this new frontier and unlock the full potential of this game-changing technology. If you have any questions or would like to explore how Generative AI can transform your organization, do not hesitate to approach me.
